          <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk" title="Google group for Ruby on Rails users">Ruby on Rails Talk</a> is where
          Rails users come to <span class="highlight">seek help, announce projects, and discuss</span>
          all kind of matters surrounding the framework and the community. If you’re working on a patch,
          you can raise issues on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core" title="Google group Ruby on Rails: Core">the core list</a>.
          Finally, there’s the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security" title="Security annoucements for Ruby on Rails">security

        <p>
          Sometimes it’s just easier to get help or <span class="highlight">discuss matters
          in real time</span>. The <em>#rubyonrails</em> channel on <em>irc.freenode.net</em>
          allows for just that. Try <em>#rails-contrib</em> if you want help or discuss your
          patch to Rails itself.
