          “Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I’ve ever used.<br class="hidden-xs" />
          And that’s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I’ve built my<br class="hidden-xs" />
          own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet API, and have created more than<br class="hidden-xs" />
          a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.”

          “It is impossible not to notice Ruby on Rails.  It has had a huge effect both in<br class="hidden-xs" />

      <blockquote>
          “What sets this framework apart from all of the others is the preference for<br class="hidden-xs" />

          to develop and understand.”

          much faster and more simply, enabling them to be more productive<br class="hidden-xs" />

          “After researching the market, Ruby on Rails stood out as the best choice.<br class="hidden-xs" />

          building on Rails and consider it a key business advantage.”

      <blockquote>
          “Ruby on Rails is astounding. Using it is like watching a kung-fu movie,<br class="hidden-xs" />
          where a dozen bad-ass frameworks prepare to beat up the little newcomer<br class="hidden-xs" />
          only to be handed their asses in a variety of imaginative ways.”
