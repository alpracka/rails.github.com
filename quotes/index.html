        <p>
          “Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I’ve ever used.<br>
          And that’s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I’ve built my<br>
          own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet API, and have created more than<br>
          a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.”
        </p>
        <p><cite>– James Duncan Davidson, Creator of Tomcat and Ant</cite></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.<br>
          Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months<br>
          to develop can be produced in a matter of days.”
        </p>
        <p><cite>– Tim O’Reilly, Founder of O’Reilly Media</cite></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “It is impossible not to notice Ruby on Rails.  It has had a huge effect both in<br>
          and outside the Ruby community... Rails has become a standard to which even<br>
          well-established tools are comparing themselves to.”
        </p>
        <p><cite>– Martin Fowler, Author of Refactoring, PoEAA, XP Explained</cite></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “What sets this framework apart from all of the others is the preference for<br>
          convention over configuration making applications easier<br>
          to develop and understand.”
        </p>
        <p><cite>– Sam Ruby, ASF board of directors</cite></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Before Ruby on Rails, web programming required a lot of verbiage, steps and time.<br>
          Now, web designers and software engineers can develop a website<br>
          much faster and more simply, enabling them to be more productive<br>
          and effective in their work.”

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “After researching the market, Ruby on Rails stood out as the best choice.<br>
          We have been very happy with that decision.  We will continue<br>
          building on Rails and consider it a key business advantage.”
        </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Ruby on Rails is astounding. Using it is like watching a kung-fu movie,<br>
          where a dozen bad-ass frameworks prepare to beat up the little newcomer<br>
          only to be handed their asses in a variety of imaginative ways.”
